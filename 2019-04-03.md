## Agenda

- Speaker Recruiting
- Topic Curation
- Meetup Organization

## Minutes

### Introduction

- (i) Above agenda items were being discussed and worked on in small groups. Results were presented and collectively reviewed afterwards.
- (i) All specific topics were discussed with a clear focus on inclusivity: making sure Hamburg JS is a safe space to foster diversity was identified as our overarching goal.

### Speaker Recruiting

#### Where & how to to find?

- Provide a high-level list of topics of interest; avoid to compete with neighboring meetups like the React & Angular meetups, though.
- Provide a list of possible formats; it doesn't always have to be a talk â€” panels, fish bowl discussions, etc. are valid options, too.
- Consider non-talk-related factors in the "CFP process", too, like the biography of the potential speaker.
- Look outside of Hamburg; folks, that give a talk in an other city might want to travel to Hamburg to speak here & have a nice evening.
- Reach out to universities & (non-obvious/-techie) companies, to get "newbie" and non-professional speakers onto the stage.

#### How to achieve diversity?

- Create & maintain a safe space.
- Make the process transparent by tweeting about it and documenting the progress in e.g. articles.
- Provide a way to contact a CoC-person anonymously.
- Make diversity a topic of talks to raise awareness.
- Reach out to "Women-only" meetup groups and similar ones.

#### How to support speakers?

- Create a knowledge base like a wiki and/or a list of links to helpful resources concerning prepearing & giving talks.
- Provide mentoring if it's feasible.
- Provide opportunities for final rehearsals.
- Consider involving not-yet-speakers into the process of preparing & giving a talk (including a joint presence on stage).
- Have a ~day-long meta-meetup about "How to prepare & apply for a talk".

#### Providing a stage for Developer Advocates ðŸ¥‘.

- It makes sense to regularly reach out to dev advocates, whether they can come around for a talk.
- Oftentimes their employer pays for travel & accomodation, which is additionally nice for us.
- Don't contact companies, though, but developer relations teams specifically; they're usually available via email, Slack, twitter, etc.

### Topic Curation

#### How do we want to select talks?

- __(d)__ Create a list of "most wanted or suggested topics" to enable potential speakers to find a topic for their talk.
- __(d)__ Provide a flipchart / wall at the current meetup to collect and vote on topics the audience wants to hear about for one of the next meetups.
- __(d)__ *during the presentation / discussion round we discovered that a call-for-papers process through a Google form might also be a strategy to collect and select talks*

#### What should be the typical duration of a talk?

- __(d)__ Lightning talks: No longer than 5 minutes.
- __(d)__ Regular talks: About 20 minutes.

#### Do we want to provide a stage for lightning talks?

- __(a)__ *hasn't been specifically answered, but according to the answers above, that "lightning talks should be 5 minutes", we might assume that the answer to this question is yes?*

#### Do we want to differentiate between beginner-friendly and advanced talks?

- __(a)__ *hasn't been specifically answered, but maybe the card "Announce meetup topics beforehand" could be seen as an answer to this?*

#### How do we want to structure the topics for one given evening?

- __(d)__ Have both, thematically mixed topics and specific topic meetups.
- __(d)__ Break the ice and create relationships by doing some games / activities with the audience at the beginning of a meetup.
- __(d)__ Allow short spontaneous presentations of "a cool npm module", "something I read in the past" or "some weird JS behaviour" etc through games like a fortune wheel (similar to Hamburgs Node.js meetups).
- __(d)__ Allow audience to present real day-by-day problems and try to solve them in the group.
- __(d)__ Once in a while we could do a "cross-over" meetup with one of the other JS related meetups to expose a greater audience to our shared topics.

#### Miscellaneous

- __(d)__ Provide tech / presentation support for first-time speakers. (should be part of [Speaker Recruiting](#speaker-recruiting))
- __(d)__ Advertise meetup communication channels (especially slack is not well known). (shouldbe part of [Meetup Organization](#meetup-organization))

### Meetup Organization

- General

  - (d) There will be shared responsibility for the time being: dedicated roles/responsibilities appear to not be required.

- Locations / Sponsorship

  - (i) Despite audience size (~100 people), finding meetup locations has never been ap problem.
  - (d) Using meetup.com as primary communications channel for potential and actual sponsors appears to be the most appropriate solution.
  - (a) Decide if we want to be more specific with regards to catering and general conditions of location sponsorship.
  - (a) Decide if we want to introduce speaker sponsorships (i.e. speaker accomodation and travel).

- Marketing / PR

  - (i) Hamburg JS already has a Meetup page and a Twitter channel, both of which we control.
  - (a) Decide if we need clear responsibilities and/or guidelines for communication on these channels.
  - (a) Decide if we want/need a regular homepage to improve visibility and ensure independence of 3rd parties.

- Communication

  - (d) We will continue using Meetup and Slack for community communication for the time being.

- Schedule
  - (d) We will set the dates for our meetups to the 5th of each (other) month. We decided to do so to make sure meetups are scheduled for alternating weekdays.
  - (d) We will exclude public holidays and weekends. If the 5th of a meetup month is a day off, we will shift it to the closest workday.
  - (a) Decide on initial cadence: monthly or bi-monthly?

### Discussion

- (i) A common understanding was reached with regards to the required individual effort required to become a part of the official Hamburg JS orga team: 2-4 hours per week.
- (i) A rather large, diverse group of candidates for membership in the orga team have stepped up.
- (i) Ideal orga team size was discussed: ~5 members appears to be a sensible team size to balance capacity to act and to decide.
- (a) Decide on orga team size and membership.
