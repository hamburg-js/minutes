### Introduction

### Speaker Recruiting

- TODO

### Topic Curation

- TODO

### Meetup Organization

- General

  - (d) There will be shared responsibility for the time being: dedicated roles/responsibilities appear to not be required.

- Locations / Sponsorship

  - (i) Despite audience size (~100 people), finding meetup locations has never been ap problem.
  - (d) Using meetup.com as primary communications channel for potential and actual sponsors appears to be the most appropriate solution.
  - (a) Decide if we want to be more specific with regards to catering and general conditions of location sponsorship.
  - (a) Decide if we want to introduce speaker sponsorships (i.e. speaker accomodation and travel).

- Marketing / PR

  - (i) Hamburg JS already has a Meetup page and a Twitter channel, both of which we control.
  - (a) Decide if we need clear responsibilities and/or guidelines for communication on these channels.
  - (a) Decide if we want/need a regular homepage to improve visibility and ensure independence of 3rd parties.

- Communication

  - (d) We will continue using Meetup and Slack for community communication for the time being.

- Schedule
  - (d) We will set the dates for our meetups to the 5th of each (other) month. We decided to do so to make sure meetups are scheduled for alternating weekdays.
  - (d) We will exclude public holidays and weekends. If the 5th of a meetup month is a day off, we will shift it to the closest workday.
  - (a) Decide on initial cadence: monthly or bi-monthly?

### Discussion

- (i) A common understanding was reached with regards to the required individual effort required to become a part of the official Hamburg JS orga team: 2-4 hours per week.
- (i) A rather large, diverse group of candidates for membership in the orga team have stepped up.
- (i) Ideal orga team size was discussed: ~5 members appears to be a sensible team size to balance capacity to act and to decide.
- (a) Decide on orga team size and membership.
