### Lightning talks

- **(d)** Timebox for lightning talks is 5 min.
- **(d)** We'll have up to 3 lightning talks per evening.

### NPM Roulette

- **(i)** Back in the days of _node.HH_ **npm roulette** was a recurring part of each meetup where attendees would come up to the stage an present an npm package of their choice which they recently discovered, used or maybe even published themselves. The rules were: Just 1 slide (the project's npm page) and max 3 minutes time. Package candidates were collected by the orga-team during the breaks and added to http://fluky.io/ – a cute wheel of fortune that was later used on stage to determine the order of talks.
- **(d)** We will revive the roulette and do one at the upcoming meetup.
- **(d)** We will change the name to **README Roulette** to broaden the scope and to avoid associations with _npm inc_.
